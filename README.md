<h1> Libft </h1>

My first library written in C.
To create this library we had to redevelop typical functions of the <strong><em>libc</em></strong> library

<h1>Functions</h1>




<h1>Skills learned</h1>

- Creation of a makefile
- Re-creation of libc library functions (string manipulation, operations on memory, writing data on files)
- Usage of pointers
