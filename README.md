<h1> Libft </h1>

My first library written in C.
To create this library we had to redevelop typical functions of the <strong><em>libc</em></strong> library

<h1>Character Functions</h1>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>isalpha</td>
    <td>Checks if the character is an alphabetic letter.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>isdigit</td>
    <td>Checks if the character is a decimal digit.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>isalnum</td>
    <td>Checks if the character is an alphanumeric character</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>isascii</td>
    <td>Checks if the character is an ASCII character</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>isprint</td>
    <td>Checks if the character is a printable character</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>toupper</td>
    <td>Converts the character to its uppercase equivalent if it's a lowercase letter.<br> If is not a lowercase letter, it returns unchanged.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>tolower</td>
    <td>Converts the character to its lowercase equivalent if it's an uppercase letter.<br> If is not an uppercase letter, it returns unchanged.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>strlen</td>
    <td>Returns the length of the string, excluding the null terminator.</td>
  </tr>

<h1>Skills learned</h1>

- Creation of a makefile
- Re-creation of libc library functions (string manipulation, operations on memory, writing data on files)
- Usage of pointers
